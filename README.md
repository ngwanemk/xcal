What is xCal?
============
The xCal project is an **open-source** project that basically does 2 things:

1. Implements the [Internet Calendaring and Scheduling Core Object Specification (RFC 5545)](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5545) such that calendaring and scheduling information (events, to-dos, journals and free/busy) are represented in the [iCalendar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICalendar) data format.

2. Develops a sofware library to facilitate the setup and hosting of calendar services, in which operations to access and edit calendar data are exposed through a calendar API.


Why xCal?
=========
First of all it is free - yeah **free** as in *free air* and not as in *free beer* i.e. "no strings attached"!

First things first 
==================
### How to obtain xCal run-times 


### Nope, how to get xCal source code

Here are 2 quick ways to receive the code:

* [Download as ZIP file from the master repository](https://github.com/reexmonkey/xcal/archive/master.zip)
* Clone the master repository: https://github.com/reexmonkey/xcal.git


### Got the source code already - what next?

xCal is written entirely in C# and in case your favorite [IDE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) is [Microsoft Visual Studio](http://www.visualstudio.com/), then the setup is guaranteed to be *pain-free* (*yeah you do not need the pain-killers*). All, you have to do is look for the solution file **xcal.sln** in the downloaded package, double-click it and *voila* - xCal project tree is automatically loaded. 

However, you may not be a Visual Studio enthusiast - perhaps a hardcore programmer who types on a basic text editor and uses command line tools to build the code or an expert user of another third-party .NET IDE. Well, in that case you may have to manually manage the project folders and files but lo! do not fear it is not a daunting task either - the following illustration hepls provide an overview of the logical layout of the directories and project files (*~~not~~ all that ends with .csproj,...*).

### Done with project setup - any further configuration?
Speaking from the heart, there is no greater killjoy (*perhaps with the exception of bugging exceptions*) than an initial waste of precious development time with mindless extra configurations during project setup. As such, the configuration of xCal is kept to the minimum. This means, no need to fret about maintaining external library dependencies, which happen to be [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/) packages that are automatically and happily resolved on the first project build. 

Nevertheless, xCal also depends on backend data management systems for logging and data storage purposes. In fact, xCal uses the [Service Stack V3](https://github.com/ServiceStackV3/ServiceStackV3) lightweight [Ormlite](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.OrmLite/tree/v3) and [Redis](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.Redis/tree/v3) libraries to respectively support either [relational database management systems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database_management_system) (*we all know [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com/)- don't we?*) or the respectable [Redis](http://redis.io/) NoSQL database. In particular, the backend systems must pre-exist on the host machine and consequently access to them must be spcified in the application settings file, as well as configuration file of [Nlog](http://nlog-project.org/); one of the logging providers used by xCal.
