Not another xCal again!
==============================
You may be forgiven if you only thought of xCal as the [XML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML) representation of the [iCalendar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICalendar) format([RFC 6321](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6321)). However, there is another xCal, which apart from implementing the standard [iCalendar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICalendar) specification ([RFC 5545](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5545)), also provides a web service interface for calendar data to be distributed under various content types such as [CSV](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values), [JSON](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON), [JSV](http://mono.servicestack.net/docs/text-serializers/jsv-format), *iCalendar* and of course XML. *This version of xCal* is a project started by [Emmanuel Ngwane](https://twitter.com/ngwanemk) (*after his many frustrated attempts to find a free open-source calendar web service*) with the support and involvement of the community.
