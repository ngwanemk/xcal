Not another xCal again!
==============================
You may be forgiven if you only thought of xCal as the [XML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML) representation of the [iCalendar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICalendar) format([RFC 6321](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6321)). However, there is *another* xCal, which implements the [iCalendar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICalendar) specification ([RFC 5545](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5545)) and in addition provides a web service interface for calendar data to be distributed under various content types such as [CSV](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values), [JSON](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON), [JSV](http://mono.servicestack.net/docs/text-serializers/jsv-format), iCalendar format and of course XML. This *so-called* xCal is a project started by [Emmanuel Ngwane](https://twitter.com/ngwanemk) (*after his many frustrated attempts to find a free open-source calendar web service*) with the support and involvement of the community.
