xCal
====

xCal is an implementation of the [iCalendar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICalendar) format as specified by the internet protocol [RFC 5545](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5546) and deployed from a web server as a service. In other words, xCal is "iCalendar as a Service (**iCaaS**)" that can be hosted on a private, public or hybrid cloud.



At first glance, xCal appears to be redudant - a "not another iCalendar application" you may be tempted to say. Why "re-invent" the wheel when popular applications used in home and business environments such as [Outlook Client](http://office.microsoft.com/en-001/outlook/), [Google Calendar](https://www.google.com/calendar/render?pli=1) are already satisfying the need for calendar-based systems? However xCal is neither redundant because it is not a custom implementation of a calendar-based system but attempts to strictly adhere to the RFC 5545 specfication.
