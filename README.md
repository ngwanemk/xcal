Not another xCal again!
==============================
You may be forgiven if you thought the only definition of xCal is the [XML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML) representation of the [iCalendar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICalendar) format as specifed by [RFC 6321](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6321) because *this* **xCal** (unlike *other xCal definitions*) is a system that implements the standard [iCalendar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICalendar) specification ([RFC 5545](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5545)), as well as provides a web service platform for calendar data to be distributed under various content types such as [CSV](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values), [JSON](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON), [JSV](http://mono.servicestack.net/docs/text-serializers/jsv-format), *iCalendar* and of course XML! 

xCal is a project started by [Emmanuel Ngwane](https://twitter.com/ngwanemk) (*after his frustrated attempts to find a free open-source calendar webs ervice*) with the support and involvement of the community.
