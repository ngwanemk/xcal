xCal
====

xCal is an implementation of the [iCalendar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICalendar) format as specified by the internet protocol [RFC 5545](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5546) and deployed from a web server as a service. In other words, xCal is "iCalendar as a Service (**iCaaS**)" that can be hosted on a private, public or hybrid cloud.



Why xCal?
=========
At first glance, xCal appears to be redudant - a "not another iCalendar application" you may be tempted to say. Why "re-invent" the wheel when popular applications used in home and business environments such as [Outlook Client](http://office.microsoft.com/en-001/outlook/), [Google Calendar](https://www.google.com/calendar/render?pli=1) are already satisfying the need for calendar-based systems? 

However unlike current calendar-based targeting home and business users, xCal is primarily a tool for software developers interested in creating time-based planning systems. For example, take the hypothetical case of Alice and Bob engaged to build a hotel reservation system for a prominent client. Both developers are smart and immediately set out to design a basic booking system from scractch. Weeks later after deployment, the client insists on compatibility of the custom booking system with the Outlook client. 






xCal as a  Format
=================
[RFC 6321](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6321) specifies an xml representation of the iCalendar format
